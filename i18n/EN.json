With 50 playouts, the AI should already beat many pro players in a game, but it might misread life & death situations sometimes. Its AI variations are about 4 moves long.\n\n**Basic** gives you access to high quality reviews for a small price. Using 500 playouts, the AI has superhuman strength and will output variations that are about 10 moves long, depending on the position ...\n\n**Dan** offers ambitious students a powerful analysis. Its 2500 playouts per move result in very precise and deep reading. The variations are about 15 moves on average, sometimes even longer.\n\n**Pro** is intended for the most intensive Go training. Using 10000 playouts, it will give you variation lengths of about 18 moves on average.\n\nThe sample game links above show the same game analyzed with all levels, so you can compare the differences for yourself.\n\n#### So which one should I take now?\nWhen in doubt, just start with **Basic**. It's really good already. Then you can always upgrade if you need more.",
